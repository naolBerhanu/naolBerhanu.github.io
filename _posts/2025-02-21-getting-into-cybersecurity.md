Breaking Into Cybersecurity: My Journey So Far

Cybersecurity is an exciting field, but getting started can feel overwhelming. I began my journey by learning Python, diving into ethical hacking, and exploring penetration testing tools. Here’s what I’ve learned so far and what I’d recommend for anyone looking to get into the field.

Key Steps I Took:

Learning Python for automation and scripting

Studying ethical hacking (CEH, OSCP materials)

Practicing with tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and Wireshark

Setting up a home lab for hands-on experience

If you’re interested in cybersecurity, start small and stay consistent. The field is vast, but persistence is key!
