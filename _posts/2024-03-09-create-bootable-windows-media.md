How to Create a Bootable Windows USB Drive

Creating a bootable Windows USB drive is essential for installing or repairing Windows on your PC. Whether you're upgrading your system or troubleshooting boot issues, this guide will walk you through the process step by step.

Requirements

A USB flash drive (at least 8GB recommended)

A working computer with an internet connection

Windows installation files (ISO file or Windows Media Creation Tool)

Method 1: Using Windows Media Creation Tool (Recommended)

Microsoft offers an official tool to create a bootable Windows USB.

Step 1: Download the Tool

Go to the Microsoft Windows Download Page (or the relevant version for Windows 11).

Click “Download tool now” under the Windows version you need.

Step 2: Prepare Your USB Drive

Insert the USB drive into your PC.

Backup any important data on the USB drive, as this process will erase it.

Step 3: Run the Tool and Create Bootable Media

Open the Media Creation Tool.

Accept the license agreement.

Choose “Create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) for another PC” and click Next.

Select the language, edition, and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) for Windows.

Choose “USB flash drive” as the installation media type and click Next.

Select your USB drive from the list and click Next.

Wait for the tool to download Windows and create the bootable drive.

Once completed, click Finish, and your USB is ready to use.

Method 2: Manually Creating a Bootable USB Using Rufus

For more control over the bootable USB, you can use Rufus, a free third-party tool.

Step 1: Download Rufus

Visit the official Rufus website.

Download the latest version of the software.

Step 2: Download the Windows ISO File

Get the Windows ISO file from Microsoft’s website.

Ensure the ISO matches the Windows version you need.

Step 3: Create the Bootable USB

Insert your USB drive into the PC.

Open Rufus and select your USB drive.

Click “Select” and choose the downloaded Windows ISO file.

Under Partition scheme, choose:

GPT for UEFI-based systems

MBR for BIOS/Legacy systems

Click Start, confirm the warning about erasing the USB, and let Rufus create the bootable drive.

Once done, eject the USB safely.

Using the Bootable USB to Install Windows

Insert the bootable USB into the target PC.

Restart the computer and enter the BIOS (press F2, F12, DEL, or ESC depending on your PC brand).

Set the USB drive as the first boot option.

Save and exit BIOS, and the Windows setup will begin.

Follow on-screen instructions to install Windows.

Conclusion

Creating a bootable Windows USB drive is straightforward using either the Windows Media Creation Tool or Rufus. This allows you to install or repair Windows on any compatible PC quickly. If you encounter any issues, double-check your USB formatting, BIOS settings, and compatibility with UEFI/Legacy modes.
